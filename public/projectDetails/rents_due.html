A shoplifting simulator with a chase scene at the end to get away from the store's rent-a-cops. This was one of my earlier projects, so while I did contribute code, 2d art, and 3d art, there were many interesting challenges to overcome.  With the short timeline of a jam, you learn to innovate quickly and find solutions.  </p><p><br></p><p>For example, putting all of the employees in carts and on Segways was a workaround for how slow my animating was at the time. The end result was better for these shortcuts. </p>
