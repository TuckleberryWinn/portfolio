For this jam, I built a low poly city, a first person driving controller, and a driving controller with custom arcade physics. We were heavily challenged by the complexities that come with larger, more open worlds, especially on such a short time table. It was incredibly satisfying to still manage to deliver just before the deadline.</p>
